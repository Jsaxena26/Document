## RC Stunt Toy Car


### Abstract

Playing with toys is a vital phase of developing up and studying the world around to come. Younger children use toys to find out their identity, assist with cognition, analyze motive and effect, discover relationships, become stronger physically, and practice skills needed in adulthood. Adults on occasion use toys to shape and toughen social bonds, teach, assist in therapy, and be mindful and reinforce lessons from their youth.
### Introduction

When you get your hands on your first remote-controlled toy, you probably are not thinking about how it actually works because you are more focused on the fun you are going to have. Radio-controlled cars (or RC cars for short) are miniature model cars, buses, or trucks that can be managed from a distance with the use of a specialized transmitter or remote.

Following are the basic principles mentioned for any RC device:

1.	User will have a transmitter or remote that will send signals to the car via radio waves, directing how they want to drive the car. The transmitter has its own power source, typically in the structure of a 9-volt battery. Without the battery, the transmitter is no longer in a position to send radio waves to the receiver.
 
2.  Once the RC toy receives the radio waves, the motors come to life with a specific action occurs. The power source will send the power to the motor and all working parts. The transmitter enables control via radio waves and the receiver activates the motors. When we press a button on the transmitter to move the RC toy forward or backward, the receiver detects the signals and sends them to the circuit.

3.	The circuit board interprets the number of electrical pulses (signals) into action. Full-function controllers have six controls and work by following pulse sequences:
a)	Forward: 16 pulses
b) Reverse: 40 pulses
c) Forward Left: 28 Pulses
d) Front Right: 34 Pulses
e) Reverse Left: 52 Pulses
f) Reverse Right: 46 Pulses

### Application

#### Parts of RC Car:

RC Car depends on some basic parts to allow the user to send commands to the vehicle, so each RC toy will have:

|Transmitter| Receiver| Power Source| Motor and circuit Board|
|-----------|---------|-------------|------------------------|
|A remote control consists of a radio transmitter that operates on a particular frequency that the receiver is designed to admit.|The receiver is fixed within the vehicle and continuously receives signals from the transmitter. When a transmission is detected, it converts the number of electrical beats into action.| All remote control cars need a power source. Rechargeable batteries power the small electric motors.| The motor is responsible for the turning motion of the toy while the circuit board acts like a pool through which all the commands go to a specific corridor.|

### Functions
First, let’s take a look at the remote control and battery.

•	This is a battery-operated product. As with all electric-powered products, precautions need to be taken during handling and use to prevent electric shock.
•	In the case of insufficient power, the flipping function will be lost in the course of playing.
•	Please no longer run on the smooth ground; otherwise the flipping function will be lost during playing.
•	Please ensure that the battery is fully charged at once.

#### Car Charging Instructions:

•	When your vehicle starts to slow down and become less responsive, it means your battery is running low. Aside from the components needed for its movement, your remote control car battery is one of the most important components of your car. If you're not taking care of your battery, your car is at risk of failing when you're having the most fun.
•	Check your battery. Choose the right adapter cable for your battery.
•	The adapter will be connected to one side of the USB charger and the battery pack will be connected to the other side.
•	Before charging always remove the battery pack from the car.
•	Use the battery pack only when the battery is fully charged.
•	Charging time is usually about 1 hour and a half.
•	A red indicator light on the charging cable means charging is in progress.
•	When charging is complete, the red light got off.
