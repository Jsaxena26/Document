## Abstract:
Sri Lanka is now on the verge of socio-economic and political collapse. The country plunged into its worst financial crisis since independence, with food, fuel, medicine, and electricity becoming increasingly scarce. Here, electricity is cut for long hours every day. Everything has stopped. People are getting troubled by this problem.

## Introduction:
Power systems are the most complex systems and are of great importance in modern life. These have a direct impact on modernization, economic, political, and social aspects.
Sri Lanka has largely relied on petroleum fuels to generate electricity. Now people are facing long power cuts due to a lack of sufficient fuel and water.

It is also expected that the poor quality of power supply interruptions will have an adverse impact on the country's GDP.
<br> 
> **Figure: 1.1** shows the strong relationship between power deficit (effective demand satisfied) and economic activity in Sri Lanka for the period 2010-2022.
 Therefore, it is understood that any unfavorable gap between the demand and supply of electricity in the country adversely affects the economy of the country.

## Government Regulations on Power Usage:
The state-owned Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) owns and operates large-scale production stations and transmission systems. The CEB has been made with 20 zones covering the entire island from 'A' to 'W' and imposed long power cuts daily on those zones.

## Energy Resources:
Sri Lanka uses various energy resources to generate electricity. Following are the types of energy resources:

&emsp;&ensp; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107342351/173843921-8e588fad-625a-42d7-bedb-65617bc29c83.png)

### - Non Renewable Energy Resources: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following resources are said to be non-renewable because the supply is limited and takes a very long time to be formed.

- Petroleum
- Fuel
- Coal
- Natural Gas
- Neutral Energy

### - Renewable Energy Resources: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following resources are called renewable because they are naturally replenished in a short period of time.

   - **Biomass:** <br>In Sri Lanka, biomass still plays a major role in the supply of primary energy. The use of bio-energy falls into two main categories:

     &emsp;&ensp; **1. Traditional:** Combustion of biomass such as wood, animal waste, and traditional charcoal.
     
     &emsp;&ensp; **2. Modern:** Production of Liquid Bio-Fuels from: <br> 
     &emsp;&ensp;&emsp;&ensp; - *Bagasse and other plants* <br> 
     &emsp;&ensp;&emsp;&ensp; - *Bio-refineries*, <br>
     &emsp;&ensp; &emsp; Biogas is produced through anaerobic digestion of residues.

 - **Solar energy:**
<br> Energy can be obtained directly from the Sun, although only slightly in cloudy weather. Sri Lanka desires to add an estimated of 11,000 MW to its power grid within the next two decades to meet the growing demand. Solar energy is generated in two most important ways:

    &emsp;&ensp; **1. Photovoltaic (PV):** 
    <br>  &emsp;&ensp; PV also called solar cells, are electronic devices that convert sunlight directly into electricity. It is installed in house panels and in <br> &emsp;&ensp; calculators. Today, PV technology is one of the fastest-growing renewable energy. <br>
    <br> &emsp;&ensp; **2. Concentrated solar power (CSP):** 
    <br>  &emsp;&ensp;  CSP uses mirrors to focus the solar rays. These rays heat the fluid, which is then driven through a heat exchanger to create steam to <br> &emsp;&ensp; drive a turbine and generate electricity. CSP is used to generate electrical energy in large scale power plants. One of the main <br> &emsp;&ensp; advantages of a CSP power plant over a solar PV power plant is that it can be equipped with molten salts in which the <br> &emsp;&ensp; heat can be stored, thereby generating electricity a few hours after sunset.

 - **Wind Energy:**
<br> Sri Lanka ranks first among other countries using wind energy for industrial applications.
The wind is used to generate electricity by using the kinetic energy created by the wind in motion. It is converted into electrical energy using wind turbines or wind power. Wind first strikes the blades of the turbines, causing them to spin and spin the turbines attached to them. It converts kinetic energy into rotational energy, by moving a shaft that is connected to a generator, and thus produces electrical energy through electromagnetism.
The amount of power used from the wind depends on the size of the turbine and the length of its blades. The output is proportional to the cube of the dimensions of the rotor and the wind speed. Theoretically, when the wind speed doubles, the wind power capacity increases eightfold.

 - **Hydropower:**
<br> Hydropower is well developed in Sri Lanka and will proceed to play an important role in the islandâ€™s power grid. Sri Lanka's electricity demand is presently met via nine thermal power stations, fifteen large hydroelectric power stations, and fifteen wind farms, with a smaller portion from smaller hydro services and other renewable energy such as solar.
In 2017, hydropower contributed about 20 percent of total electrical energy generation, of which greater than 70 percent came from thermal sources and a small portion from other renewable sources.
Hydropower output has been affected by way of variability in monsoon patterns, which have improved substantially in recent decades due to climate change. 

&emsp;&ensp; *How hydropower works:* <br>
&emsp;&nbsp; A common hydroelectric plant is a system consisting of three parts: 

  &emsp;&nbsp; 1. &nbsp; An electricity plant where electrical energy is produced, 
  
  &emsp;&nbsp; 2. &nbsp; A dam that can be opened or closed to manage water flow, and 
  
  &emsp;&nbsp; 3. &nbsp; A reservoir is the place water is stored. 

&emsp;&nbsp; The water behind the dam flows through consumption and pushes against blades in a turbine, causing them to twist. The turbine spins a &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generator to generate electricity.
<br>
<br>
## National Energy supply source:
Sri Lanka's primary energy supply comes mainly from oil and coal. In 2017, about 40% of Sri Lanka's electricity is growing from hydropower, but the share of coal in electricity generation has been increasing since 2010.

- Fishermen limit fishing and shops and industries to limit production and business due to power outages.

- Intensive care unit (ICU) and high dependency unit (HDU) are facing issues due to prolonged power cuts.

## Conclusion:
Despite Sri Lanka being on the edge of a Socio-Economic and Political crisis, this particular moment marks a significant milestone in history. Currently, the power generation sector is dominated by liquid petroleum fuels. As of 2017, Sri Lanka spent 29.5% of its export earnings on fuel imports. Hence the financial resources of the country get exhausted heavily from the country due to high import costs. Therefore, the entire history of Sri Lanka may change in the next few weeks.
